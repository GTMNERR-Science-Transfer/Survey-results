# Survey data cleaning and organizing

# Important notes on how the data is organized:
# 1. If there is only one choice for people, the results show numbers in one
# column
# 2. If people can choose several options, there will be a column for each option
# 3. Question IDs (QID...) are not in order and neither are the multiple choice
# options from point 1. See the file questions_detail.csv for details.
