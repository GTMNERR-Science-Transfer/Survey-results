Please read this consent document carefully before you decide to participate in this study.



Purpose of the research study: The University of Florida and Guana Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) Research Reserve are partnering with the local community and broader science community to develop a web-based, public-facing, interactive dashboard to provide access to Guana Estuary datasets. The aim of this work is to support open science and to increase diverse engagement by making the data available interactively, using visualization tools. To this end, we are seeking feedback from those who have been involved with the Guana Estuary to help us better understand their needs.



What you will be asked to do in the study: Answer survey questions on your involvement with the Guana Estuary, your current and potential data needs, and your preferences for functionalities of the dashboard.



Time required: Approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the survey questions



Benefits: There are no direct benefits to you for participating in the study.



Risks: There are no risks to you for participating in the study.



Compensation: There is no compensation for participating in the study.



Confidentiality: Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. The names of the participants will not be used in any research reports or presentations. Your name or email address will not be connected to your responses once data collection is concluded. Data related to the survey will be de-identified, i.e., codes such as p1, p2, p3 etc. will be used instead of personal information. This will happen prior to any analyses or reporting of the data. During data collection, the table linking unique IDs (p1, p2, p3 etc.) to participant's identification will be accessed only by the PI and study coordinator. The results might be presented in a paper and might be sent to research journals for possible publication or used in research conference presentations. No names or other identifying information will be used in reporting.



Voluntary participation: Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.



Right to withdraw from the study: You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without consequence. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer.



Whom to contact if you have questions about the study: Dr. Geraldine Klarenberg, School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences. University of Florida (gklarenberg@ufl.edu), or Kristie Perez, School of Natural Resources and Environment. University of Florida (kristieperez@ufl.edu).



If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this study, please contact the UF IRB office: Telephone: (352) 392-0433, e-mail address: irb2@ufl.edu
