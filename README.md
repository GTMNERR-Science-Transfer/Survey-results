The Guana Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) NERR in northeast Florida includes multiple water resources where both physical access and access to data is in demand by a wide variety of user groups across several systems and unique habitat types. The needs of these users vary widely and extend beyond the information currently accessible through the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) for which data is available through the Centralized Data Management Office. 

This project will develop an open data science product to provide access to non-SWMP ecological data sets and visualizations for the Guana River Estuary (GRE) through an interactive web-based dashboard, expanding engagement to include the community. 

The project was kickstarted with a virtual meeting (Nov 2022), followed by a participatory in-person follow-up meeting (Dec 2022). A survey was distributed to obtain information about users' needs, both in terms of data sets as well as dashboard features.

This repository has R scripts pertaining to the survey. They:
1. Download responses of potential data users,
2. Download and reorganize questions and answers to create a unified metadata file,
3. Deidentify and clean data, creating subsets of question groups, and
4. Create exploratory and summative figures and tables for each question group.
