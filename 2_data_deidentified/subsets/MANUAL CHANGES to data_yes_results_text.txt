Manual changes to "data_yes_results_text.csv".
Some people answered "Other" for their preferred way of accessing data, but then filled 
in websites as an  answer. These answers were manually re-classified.

Row 11: 
* Under q_text, changed "Other (please specify)" to "Download from website (If so what website?)"
* Changed q_code from 4 to 2
* Changed qname from 1_YD-2_4_TEXT to 1_YD-2_2_TEXT

Same for row 12, 13, 21, 25, 34, 56
