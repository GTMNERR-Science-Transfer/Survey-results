<br>
<u>Please read this consent document carefully before you decide to participate in this study.</u><br>
<br>
<strong>Purpose of the research study:</strong> The University of Florida and Guana Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) Research Reserve are partnering with the local community and broader science community to develop a web-based, public-facing, interactive dashboard to provide access to Guana Estuary datasets. <strong>The aim of this work is to support open science and to increase diverse engagement by making the data available interactively, using visualization tools.</strong> To this end, we are seeking feedback from those who have been involved with the Guana Estuary to help us better understand their needs.<br>
<br>
<strong>What you will be asked to do in the study:</strong> Answer survey questions on your involvement with the Guana Estuary, your current and potential data needs, and your preferences for functionalities of the dashboard.<br>
<br>
<strong>Time required:</strong> Approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the survey questions<br>
<br>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in the study.<br>
<br>
<strong>Risks: </strong>There are no risks to you for participating in the study.<br>
<br>
<strong>Compensation: </strong>There is no compensation for participating in the study.<br>
<br>
<strong>Confidentiality: </strong>Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. The names of the participants will not be used in any research reports or presentations. Your name or email address will not be connected to your responses once data collection is concluded. Data related to the survey will be de-identified, i.e., codes such as p1, p2, p3 etc. will be used instead of personal information. This will happen prior to any analyses or reporting of the data. During data collection, the table linking unique IDs (p1, p2, p3 etc.) to participant's identification will be accessed only by the PI and study coordinator. The results might be presented in a paper and might be sent to research journals for possible publication or used in research conference presentations. No names or other identifying information will be used in reporting.<br>
<br>
<strong>Voluntary participation: </strong>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.<br>
<br>
<strong>Right to withdraw from the study: </strong>You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without consequence. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer.<br>
<br>
<strong>Whom to contact if you have questions about the study: </strong>Dr. Geraldine Klarenberg, School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences. University of Florida (gklarenberg@ufl.edu), or Kristie Perez, School of Natural Resources and Environment. University of Florida (kristieperez@ufl.edu).<br>

BACKGROUND<br>
<br>
The University of Florida and Guana Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) Research Reserve are partnering with the local community and broader science community <u>to develop a web-based, public-facing, interactive dashboard to provide access to <strong>Guana Estuary</strong> datasets</u>. <strong>The aim of this research is to support open science and to increase diverse engagement by making the data available interactively, using visualization tools</strong>. To this end, we are seeking feedback from those who have been involved with the Guana Estuary to help us better understand their needs!<br>
<br>
For the purposes of this project, and this survey, ""Guana Estuary"" refers to the Guana Lake and Guana River: the area north and south of the Guana Dam, from Micklers Road to the Tolomato River / intracoastal - see the map below.<br>

QID27,TOOL CHARACTERISTICS,"<br>The major goal of this project is to develop a dashboard* to enhance open access to scientific data about the Guana Estuary.

QID48,TR-0,"Are you part of the <strong>stakeholder group</strong> that was invited to participate in the project kick-off meetings in <u>November and December 2022</u> (If you are unsure, click &quot;No&quot;. If you were invited but could not make it, click &quot;Yes&quot;).",TRUE
QID32,TRUST,"For our work, stakeholders are people who would be impacted by the availability of a Guana Estuary data dashboard such as community members, natural resource managers, and professionals like educators, local officials, and others.<br>
<br>
Stakeholder engagement has become a key element in the natural resource management and environmental science and policy domains. Trust is imperative to meaningful stakeholder engagement. Trust can be defined as a willingness of one entity (for instance stakeholders) to be vulnerable to the discretionary actions of another (for instance the project team).<br>
<br>
For the next set of questions, we are interested in understanding your opinions on trust and other related concepts as they pertain to our work together in creating an open data/open science dashboard.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and feedback will not only enable us to evaluate our process design and make any necessary adjustments going forward to ensure the success of our project, but also allow us to evaluate aspects of our project within the broader context of global stakeholder engagement in natural resources.<br>
